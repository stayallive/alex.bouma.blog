**tl;dr about me:** Iâ€™m an entrepreneur, developer and [artisan](http://laravel.com). I co-founded [Simulise](https://www.simulise.com/en). I build applications for the web, mobile and desktop and also manage & maintain some servers.

#### About the entrepreneur part

I work (and co-founded)Â [@Simulise](https://www.simulise.com/en "Simulise"), a little bit about it:

> Students have to present themselves better than ever. After the student's formal education has finished, employers and clients expect to see insight into the skills of a person and want to know what to expect from a candidate. Educational institutions are expected to give skills a permanent place in the curriculum. This is why the online portfolio of Simulise makes those skills transparent for students and teachers -both during school time and afterwards.Â *â€”Â [Simulise](https://www.simulise.com/en)*

My responsibility is mostly running the "IT" side of the company. This ranges from development of our SaaS application to keeping our servers spinning.

On the side I run a ~~little~~ small hosting company founded by me called [Alboweb](https://www.alboweb.nl). I host a large variety of sites like the [@Simulise](https://www.simulise.com/en "Simulise") website, some very small sites, some as big as >6M pageviews per day (although these don't run on shared infra).
 
We provide shared and managed hosting services on dedicated or virtual private servers. It is a great way to keep my sysadmin skills up-to-date and pet my ego when I look at our beautiful uptime reports ðŸ¤“.

#### About the developer part

In the few free hours I have I do some consulting and work on a freelance basis as [Devalex](https://devalex.nl/). I work with very little to very big companies from setting up infrastructure to checking out their code or to simply step in to get sh*t done.

I'm also one of the core developers for the [Sentry](https://sentry.io) [PHP SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php) and the [Laravel integration](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php) (and unofficially also the [WordPress integration](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry)). If you don't know Sentry and build any kind of application, go check them out to level up your error reporting.

And if that wasn't enough things to keep me busy I'm also building [Chief Tools](https://chief.app/) (mostly scratching my own itch).

~~<del datetime="2016-01-26T18:30:00+00:00">Currently</del>~~ I worked as resident code monkey [@iCulture](http://iculture.nl), the largest (and best of course) Dutch Apple focused news site. Here I ~~work~~ worked to make WordPress less awkward and [better/faster/stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ) for the writers and readers. The site is built on WordPress, but also uses the [Laravel Lumen](http://lumen.laravel.com) framework (to make our iOS apps blazing fast ðŸ”¥) and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) (as our awesome [search](http://www.iculture.nl/?s=nieuwe%20zoekfunctie) backbone).

#### About the artisan part

I _love_ the [Laravel](http://laravel.com) PHP framework and have built quite some applications (both private and [public](https://alex.bouma.dev/tag/projects/)) with it (since version 3 all the way up to 7). Have any questions? Hit me up on the [Larachat](https://larachat.co/) Slack group (@stayallive), shoot me an [email](mailto:alex+laravel@bouma.dev) or maybe ping me on Twitter [@stayallive](https://twitter.com/stayallive "Twitter - Stayallive") if you can fit it in 280 chars ðŸ˜‰.

#### Get in contact

If you want to talk to me you can shoot me an [email](mailto:alex@bouma.dev) or hit me up on TwitterÂ [@stayallive](https://twitter.com/stayallive "Twitter - Stayallive")Â (yeah, thatâ€™s with 2 lâ€™s).

Want to share server access or sharing something that needs to be secret, use one of my [public keys](/public-key).
