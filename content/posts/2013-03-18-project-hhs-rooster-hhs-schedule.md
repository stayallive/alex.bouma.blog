> **Update:** This application is now useless since they switched systems (finally :)~~, leaving it here for nostalgic reasons~~.

The [The Hague University of Applied Sciences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague_University_of_Applied_Sciences) uses a very basic and hard to use (in the mobile world we live in) scheduling system. They generate very basic html pages with the schedule in it, however no way to see it nicely on our mobile phone or let alone in our calendars.

So I created a tool that finds the HTML schedule and parses it to a .ics that most mobile/calendering solutions can read and use, and even update it on the fly.

Enjoy!
