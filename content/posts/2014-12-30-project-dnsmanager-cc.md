With [dnsmanager.io](https://app.dnsmanager.io/ "dnsmanager.io") you can easily manage the DNS records of all your domain names on an battle tested premium service. Domains can be easily (in bulk) created and edited with predefined templates or through our simple API (or using one of our integrations with for example Plesk as an extension). Our webinterface is multilangual (English and Dutch) and has 15 themes to choose from.

It is also possible to use our whitelabel nameservers and reseller functionality to deliver our DNS service to your customers, with the API your customer can’t even tell we got your back. Possibilities as a [dnsmanager.io](https://app.dnsmanager.io/ "dnsmanager.io") reseller are:

- Your own domain name for our nameservers (using glue-records)
- Configure your own domain (and SSL certificate) for our webinterface
- Set your company name in the webinterface and we won’t even mention dnsmanager.cc
- Set the default language & theme for all your customers

Try [dnsmanager.io](https://app.dnsmanager.io/ "dnsmanager.io") unlimited for free! For question and/or sales questions please contact us through [support@dnsmanager.io](mailto:support@dnsmanager.io).
