![Multiple versions](/img/ghost/Screen-Shot-2015-04-07-at-22-05-26.jpg)

Today I noticed that Plesk 12 since micro update 41 can install PHP 5.2 up to ~~5.6~~ 7.0 via the built-in installer, this makes the scripts I made obsolete.

If you are still running 11.5 Parallels (or ~~Odin~~ Plesk) also put up official guides telling you how to install php 5.6 wich can be modified to install most versions.

Don’t believe me? Go and see for yourself: [http://kb.odin.com/en/118378](http://kb.odin.com/en/118378)
